### 2.2 Assisted Coding with the Plugin

#### 2.2.1 Template Generation

On a problem description page, click `Template` in the plugin main UI or choose `Generate Template` from the context menu.

Template generation settings:

- Template Type:
  - Full: replaces important logical checks and assignments with placeholders; you implement key logic.
  - Data Structures: based on Full and retains basic data definitions; hints which data structures to use; algorithm flow is implemented by you.
  - Algorithms: based on Full and retains control flow; hints a general solving process; you choose data structures and complete the algorithm.
  - Original: raw template, not processed, not directly submittable.
- Language: currently only Java.
- Model: includes templates generated by GA (Genetic Algorithm), GA-OPT (optimized version that fixes identifier inconsistency; preferred), GPT, DeepSeek, Qwen, Doubao, Gemini, Claude. Choose `All` to show all methods.
- Example Count: templates extracted from multiple AC codes; uses at least N examples. More examples yield more general templates.
- TopK: view the top K templates by score.

Click `Generate Template` to generate and view templates. You can copy a module or the full text.

The plugin records template generation options and copy actions (templates only) for evaluation.

#### 2.2.2 Submission Data Collection

When a code submission is detected, a dialog asks for the result (success/failure). The prompt also appears when viewing submission history. Click outside the dialog to skip.

You can upload the code from each submission to analyze whether templates improve code quality.

Steps:

1. Choose `Yes` in the prompt and copy the code from the submission record.
2. Wait for the `Enter Code` dialog, paste the copied code, and click `Submit`.

#### 2.2.3 Feedback Collection

After a successful submission, you will be prompted to provide feedback immediately. Choose `Yes` to go to the feedback page, or `No` to complete it later via `Feedback` on the home page.

#### Template Feedback System

###### Template Correctness Evaluation

1. Logic Accuracy Score: does the template accurately reflect the problem-solving logic framework/process?

   - 5: completely matches the logic framework/process
   - 4: generally matches with minor issues (e.g., missing key logic, extra code, incorrect processing flow)
   - 3: mostly matches with some deficiencies
   - 2: significant deficiencies in the logic framework
   - 1: does not match the logic framework/process

2. Code Error Score: does the template contain structural/syntax errors?

   - 5: no errors
   - 4: very few minor errors that do not affect understanding
   - 3: some minor errors; core functionality is correct; small fixes needed
   - 2: many errors that impact understanding; requires modifications
   - 1: multiple severe errors; severely impacts understanding; requires major changes

   Possible error types:

   - Structural errors: indentation issues, mismatched brackets
   - Statement order errors: using variables before definitions
   - Variable naming issues: meaningless names, using undefined variables
   - Function naming issues: meaningless names, definition–usage mismatch
   - Other issues: describe in the text box

###### Template Usefulness Evaluation

3. Learning Value Score: does the template help you learn approaches for this class of problems?

   - 5: extremely helpful
   - 4: very helpful
   - 3: somewhat helpful
   - 2: limited help
   - 1: not helpful

4. Efficiency Score: does the template improve your problem-solving efficiency?

   - 5: greatly improves efficiency
   - 4: clear improvement
   - 3: little effect
   - 2: slightly reduces efficiency
   - 1: severely reduces efficiency

   Possible reasons for improved efficiency:

   - Provides a good starting point
   - Focuses attention on core logic
   - Inspires/reinforces problem-solving ideas
   - Others (please specify)

   Possible reasons for reduced efficiency:

   - Low template quality (e.g., incorrect logic, code errors)
   - Inconsistent with the user's original approach
   - Not the user's habitual coding style
   - Others (please specify)

5. Code Style Score: is the style represented by the template worth learning?

   - 5: highly worth learning
   - 4: worth learning
   - 3: average
   - 2: poor
   - 1: not worth learning

6. Overall Rating

   - 5: very useful; significantly improves the problem-solving experience
   - 4: useful; improves the experience
   - 3: average; some help
   - 2: limited effect
   - 1: almost no effect

###### Additional Feedback

7. Extra Suggestions (optional)
   - Provide explanations for your rating scores
   - Describe your usage experience and the specific scenarios where you used the templates
   - Comment on the benefits and limitations of the templates
   - Provide any extra feedback, suggestions, or specific improvement ideas about the template

## 3. Other Features (auxiliary; not in this test scope)

### Get Problem-Solving Guidance from LLMs

Preparation: on the plugin home under `Models`, configure the model `api-key` (stored locally in the browser). DeepSeek is recommended.

Usage: on a problem description page, click `Guidance` in the plugin main UI or choose `Get Guidance` from the context menu. Select the model and the programming language for guidance, click `Get Guidance`, and view the result in a new tab.
